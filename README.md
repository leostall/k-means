# K-means Clustering

## 📘 Introduction
This repository contains an analysis and implementation of the **K-means clustering algorithm**, presented in the course **Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning**. The algorithm is applied to group data points based on similarity, optimizing data analysis and discovering hidden patterns.

## 📂 Project Content
- **Slides**: Presentation slides in both **PDF** and **PPT** formats explaining the theory and applications of the K-means algorithm.
- **Code Examples**: Sample Python code implementing the K-means algorithm for clustering data and visualizing results.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - `numpy`: For numerical operations.
  - `matplotlib`: For plotting data clusters.
  - `sklearn`: For applying the K-means algorithm and handling datasets.

## 💻 How to Run the Code
1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/leostall/K-means-Clustering-Analysis.git
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    Make sure you have Python installed, then install the necessary libraries:
    ```bash
    pip install numpy matplotlib sklearn
    ```

3. **Run the code**:
    Open the code file (`kmeans centroides.py`) and run it to see how the K-means algorithm works on a sample dataset.

## 📝 Slides
- **PDF** and **PPT** versions of the presentation slides are available in the `slides` folder. They cover:
  - What is K-means?
  - The importance and applications of K-means.
  - Mathematical foundation and the elbow method for determining the best number of clusters.
